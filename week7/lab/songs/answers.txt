1. By executing the following SQL command:
"SELECT AVG(energy), AVG(danceability), AVG(valence) FROM songs;" ,
we attain the average values for:
energy (0.65906),
danceability (0.71646),
and valence (0.484443)
=> Relatively high energy and danceability => Purple, Orange

2. A better way to calculate the "energetic-ness" of the song is by
combining energy, danceability, tempo of the song.
A way to show how the song's vibe is is by looking at loudness and valence.
Speechiness would help us to know more about whether the song help the listener
to focus. (Less word means more focused)
